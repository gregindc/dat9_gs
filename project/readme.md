# Project Proposal - Kaggle Competition/AXA Telematics

**What is the question you hope to answer?** Based on the Kaggle competition description, I intend to develop a method to fingerprint drivers based on the characteristics of their driving. A set of data containing mostly drives from 1 person will be run against the models to determine if all drives were completed by a single person or multiple people.

**What do you know about the data so far?** The data available contains folders with drive data from mostly a single driver. Some false or incorrect records exist in the data, but per the competition description, the data in each folder can generally be assumed to be from one person.
